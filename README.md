# üöò PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project showcases solutions to a series of SQL interview questions from a mock Ford dataset. It demonstrates my ability to use advanced SQL techniques such as Common Table Expressions (CTEs), window functions, aggregation, and data cleaning logic to solve real-world business problems.

One example involves calculating month-over-month growth in service appointments, where I used a CTE combined with the LAG() function to compare monthly totals ‚Äî a useful technique in trend analysis and reporting.

## üìåQUESTIONS SOLVED
- **QUESTION 1**  
     - Find customers who purchased the same vehicle model more than once in the same year.
