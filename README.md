# PROJECT OVERVIEW

I solved a collection of sql interview questions from Ford, where for example I had to use a CTE to calculate month-over-month % growth and within that same query I had to use a LAG window function to get last month appointment counts, this is useful for month-over-month comparisons.

## QUESTIONS
- **QUESTION 1**  
     - Find customers who purchased the same vehicle model more than once in the same year.
- **QUESTION 2**
     -  Identify vehicles not serviced in the last 12 months.
- **QUESTION 3**
     - Get top 3 dealers per region based on profit (revenue - cost) for Quarter 1 2025.
- **QUESTION 4**
     - Calculate the month-over-month % growth in service appointments in 2024.

     - Flag older records where customer email and phone are duplicated.
- **QUESTION 6**
     - Find customers who bought both Ford Mustang and Ford Figo.
