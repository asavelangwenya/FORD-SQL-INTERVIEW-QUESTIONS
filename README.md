# PROJECT OVERVIEW

I solved a collection of sql interview questions from Ford, where I had to use  a CTE to calculate month-over-month % growth and within that same query I had to use a LAG window function to get last month appointment counts, thisis useful for month-over-month comparisons.

- # QUESTION 1 #
